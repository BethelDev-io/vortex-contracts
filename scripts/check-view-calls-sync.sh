# Issue #290 / #495: Check that examples/view-calls.postman_collection.json is in
# sync with the actual read-only view functions across all six contracts.
#
# This script:
# 1. Extracts all pub fn get_*/is_*/list_* functions from each contract's lib.rs
# 2. Verifies each one has a corresponding request in the Postman collection
# 3. Fails (exit 1) if drift is detected, succeeds (exit 0) if in sync
#
# Heuristic: a function is considered a "view" if it:
#   - Starts with get_, is_, or list_ (read-only naming convention)
#   - Is declared as "pub fn"
# This is conservative and may need refinement as the contract evolves.
#
# Collection request names are prefixed with the contract name (e.g.
# "governor: get_config") so entries from different contracts stay distinct.

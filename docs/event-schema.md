## Conventions

Soroban events carry two parts:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Topics** | An ordered tuple encoded as a `Vec<Val>`. The first element is always a `Symbol` (the event name). Additional elements identify the principal actor (solver, user, admin address). |
| **Data / Payload** | A single `Val` — scalar, tuple, or struct — containing the event's variable data. |

All `Address` values are Stellar account or contract addresses (StrKey encoded
off-chain). All token amounts are `i128` in the bond token's smallest unit
(stroops for USDC with 7 decimal places: `1_000_000 = 0.1 USDC`).

#### `bond_withdrawn`

```

---

#### `intent_filled`

Emitted by `fill_intent` on each (partial or full) fill. Emitted even when the
intent transitions to `PartiallyFilled` rather than `Filled` — the cumulative
`fill_amount` in the `IntentRecord` tracks overall progress.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **topics[0]** | `Symbol` | `"intent_filled"` |
| **topics[1]** | `Address` | `solver` — the solver that delivered this fill |

## State Transition Summary

The table below shows which event drives each `IntentState` transition. An
indexer can fully reconstruct intent state by replaying these events in
ledger order.

| From state | To state | Driving event |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| _(none)_ | `Open` | `intent_submitted` |
| `Open` | `Accepted` | `intent_accepted` |
| `Open` | `Cancelled` | `intent_cancelled` |
| `Open` | `Expired` | `intent_expired` |
| `Accepted` | `PartiallyFilled` → re-opens as `Open` | `intent_filled` (partial) |
| `Accepted` | `Filled` | `intent_filled` (cumulative ≥ min_dst_amount) |
| `Accepted` | `Open` / `PartiallyFilled` (re-opened) | `solver_slashed` (`slash_cycles < max_slash_cycles`) |
| `Accepted` | `Abandoned` | `solver_slashed` + `intent_abandoned` (`slash_cycles >= max_slash_cycles`) |
| `PartiallyFilled` | `Accepted` | `intent_accepted` |
| `PartiallyFilled` | `Expired` | `intent_expired` |
| `PartiallyFilled` | `Cancelled` | `intent_cancelled` |

`Abandoned` is terminal: an intent that hits `ProtocolConfig.max_slash_cycles`
repeated `Accepted → Slashed` cycles no longer re-opens; the user must
resubmit a fresh intent (issue #241).

> **Bidding mode:** If bid-window mode is active, `intent_submitted` opens the
> intent in `Bidding` state. `bid_intent` events (not yet emitted as named
> events) track competing quotes; `settle_bids` transitions to `Accepted`.
> This path is omitted above as the bid-event schema will be specified
> separately once the feature is finalized.

## Indexer Notes

1. **Topic layout matters.** Events with a solver/user in `topics[1]` are
   queryable by address using the Horizon `/accounts/{id}/effects` or
   Soroban RPC `getEvents` filter `{ "topics": [["*", "<address>"]] }`.

2. **`bond_withdrawn` balance parity.** The `remaining` field in the
   `bond_withdrawn` payload (`data[1]`) lets an indexer maintain a real-time
   solver bond ledger without ever calling `get_solver`. Combine with
   `solver_registered` (incremental deposit) and `solver_slashed` (slash
   amount) and `solver_deregistered` (full refund) to reconstruct the full
   bond history:
   - `bond` += `bond_amount` on `solver_registered`
   - `bond` -= `slash_amount` on `solver_slashed`
   - `bond`  = `remaining` on `bond_withdrawn` (authoritative snapshot)
   - `bond`  = 0 on `solver_deregistered`

3. **`open_intents` counter.** `get_stats` now returns a third value,
   `open_intents`, tracking intents currently in `Open` state. See issue #109
   and the trade-off note in `get_stats` for details. Indexers may use this as
   a cross-check against their own event-replayed count.

4. **Partial fills.** A single intent may emit `intent_filled` multiple times
   before reaching `Filled`. Each emission carries that fill's incremental
   `fill_amount` (not cumulative). Sum all `intent_filled.data[1]` for the
   same `intent_id` to get total volume for that intent.

   As of #244, this no longer strictly requires event replay:
   `get_intent_fill_history(intent_id)` returns an on-chain
   `Vec<(solver, amount, timestamp)>` log of each fill for that intent
   directly, bounded at `MAX_FILL_HISTORY` (20) entries with the oldest
   entry evicted first once the cap is reached. For intents with more than
   20 partial fills, event replay is still required for the full history.

## Issue #377 — SDK upgrade migration note

All crates currently pin `soroban-sdk = "21.0.0"`. When upgrading to the
next major release:

1. **Typed events** (`#[contractevent]`): replace raw
   `env.events().publish((Symbol::new(...),), data)` calls with typed structs
   annotated `#[contractevent]`. The encoding of topics and data does not
   change for simple `(symbol, address)` patterns, but compound topics may
   need verification against the indexer fixtures.

2. **Test registration**: `env.register_contract(None, T)` becomes
   `env.register(T, ())` in sdk ≥ 22. The bench and test files already use
   `register_stellar_asset_contract_v2` (the newer API).

3. **TTL/auth APIs**: no breaking changes expected for the patterns used here
   (`extend_ttl`, `require_auth`, `mock_all_auths`).

4. **Event compatibility**: run the reference-indexer test suite
   (`indexer/reference-indexer.test.js`) against fixtures generated with both
   SDK versions before merging. Any encoding change must be documented here.

# Event Schema — `backstop_vault`

> Added in issue #519. Source of truth: `backstop_vault/src/lib.rs`.

The backstop vault is an LP pool that absorbs solver-default losses and earns a
share of protocol fees and slash proceeds. All token amounts are `i128` in the
bond token's smallest unit (stroops for USDC with 7 decimal places).

# Event Schema — `treasury_streams`

> Added in issue #519. Source of truth: `treasury_streams/src/lib.rs`.

`treasury_streams` manages timelocked token vesting streams for grants and
contributor payments. All amounts are `i128` in the token's smallest unit.
Stream IDs are monotonically increasing `u64` counters.

> **Note:** `treasury_streams` uses `soroban_sdk::symbol_short!` for the event
> name topic (max 9 bytes), so the symbol values are exactly `"create"`,
> `"withdraw"`, and `"cancel"` — not longer names.

# Event Schema — `intent_periphery`

> Added in issue #519. Source of truth: `intent_periphery/src/lib.rs`.

`intent_periphery` is a read-only proxy that aggregates heavy view and
governance surfaces from the core `intent_settlement` contract. It emits only
two administrative events (it never moves funds).

## Event Catalogue

---

#### `periphery_initialized`

Emitted by `initialize` on first-time setup.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **topics[0]** | `Symbol` | `"periphery_initialized"` |
| **data[0]** | `Address` | `admin` |
| **data[1]** | `Address` | `settlement` — the core contract this periphery reads from |

```
topics : ("periphery_initialized",)
data   : (admin: Address, settlement: Address)
```

---

#### `settlement_updated`

Emitted by `set_settlement` when the admin points the periphery at a new core
settlement contract (e.g. after a core upgrade).

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **topics[0]** | `Symbol` | `"settlement_updated"` |
| **data** | `Address` | `settlement` — the new settlement contract address |

```
topics : ("settlement_updated",)
data   : <settlement: Address>
```

# Event Schema — `governor`

> Added in issue #519. Source of truth: `governor/src/lib.rs`.

The `governor` contract manages stake-weighted on-chain governance. As of this
writing the governor does **not yet emit events** — state transitions are
recorded entirely in persistent storage and can be reconstructed via the
`state`, `get_proposal`, and `voting_power` view functions.

Event emission for `proposed`, `voted`, `queued`, and `executed` transitions is
tracked in the open roadmap item referenced by this issue. When those events are
added, this section will be expanded with their full schemas.

# Event Schema — `fee_router`

> Added in issue #519. Source of truth: `fee_router/src/lib.rs`.

`fee_router` is implemented as a **pure Rust library crate** (not a Soroban
contract), so it does not emit Soroban events via `env.events().publish()`.
Revenue accounting (`on_fee_received`, `distribute`, `claim`), weight changes
(`propose_weights`, `apply_weights`), and error conditions are surfaced
exclusively through return values and the caller's own event layer.

If `fee_router` is later promoted to a standalone Soroban contract, this
section will be updated with its event schema.
